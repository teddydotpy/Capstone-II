### Capstone II

In this capstone project we design a recurrent neural netwrok to explore how it would fare in predicting how the language in a yelp review is meant i.e positive or negative. The network is trained using the adam optimizer with 64 batch size and 1000 epocs. After trying out around 30000 epochs and training it for a while it was noticed that the network capped at an accuracy of 71 % after 100 iterations. 

The images below describe the acccuracy and losss over the iterations respectively.
